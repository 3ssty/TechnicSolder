TechnicSolder - TechnicAPI on Laravel
===================================

Port of CI based TechnicAPI to Laravel v3.2.13, with some new features creeping in. To start with default config files, copy the application/config-sample directory to application/config. If using .htaccess, use a copy of public/.htaccess-sample. After configuring Laravel as usual, edit application/config/solder.php to make things go.

For new features, edit application/config/database.php as needed and use artisan migrate to get your database configured.
